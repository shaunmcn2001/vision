### New Backend URL

The application now defaults to: `https://vision-backend-0l94.onrender.com`

### How to Use

1. **Development**: The app will automatically connect to the new backend URL
2. **GitHub Pages Deployment**: Set `VITE_BACKEND_URL` as a repository secret
3. **Local Override**: Create `.env.local` with `VITE_BACKEND_URL=your-custom-url` if needed

### Verification

To verify everything is working:
1. Open the application
2. Check the Settings panel - you should see the backend status as green/connected
3. The field list should load automatically
4. NDVI data should be accessible without any API key configuration

### Removed Components

The following environment variables are no longer used:
- `VITE_API_KEY` (no longer needed)

The application now has a simpler, more streamlined configuration focused solely on the backend URL.
