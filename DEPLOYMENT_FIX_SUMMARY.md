# GitHub Actions Deployment Fix Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Package Dependency Mismatches
**Problem**: 
- `@github/spark` version mismatch (package.json required `^0.39.0` but workspace had `0.0.1`)
- Missing @octokit dependencies in package-lock.json due to workspace conflicts
- Workspace configuration causing npm ci to fail in GitHub Actions

**Solution**:
- Removed workspace configuration from package.json
- Removed `packages/spark-tools` directory containing local `@github/spark` package
- Removed `@github/spark` dependency from package.json
- Created custom `useKV` hook to replace `@github/spark/hooks` functionality
- Updated all imports to use local hooks instead of `@github/spark`
- Regenerated package-lock.json with clean dependency resolution

### 2. Environment Variable Configuration
**Problem**: GitHub Actions workflow didn't properly handle environment variables from secrets

**Solution**:
- Updated `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to use environment variables from GitHub secrets
- Added support for `VITE_BACKEND_URL` and `VITE_API_KEY` secrets
- Created proper fallback handling in application code

### 3. Import Resolution Issues
**Problem**: Application imported non-existent `@github/spark/spark` module

**Solution**:
- Removed `@github/spark/spark` import from main.tsx
- Created localStorage-based useKV hook that provides the same API
- Updated all test mocks to use local hooks

## Files Modified

### Core Application Files
- `src/hooks/useKV.ts` - Created custom hook to replace @github/spark functionality
- `src/hooks/index.ts` - Export barrel for hooks
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated import to use local hooks
- `src/main.tsx` - Removed @github/spark import
- All component files - Updated imports to use `../hooks` instead of `@github/spark/hooks`

### Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Removed @github/spark dependency and workspace configuration
- `package-lock.json` - Regenerated with clean dependency resolution
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Added environment variable support

### Test Files
- `src/tests/EnvironmentConfig.test.tsx` - Updated mock imports
- `src/tests/build-validation.test.ts` - Created comprehensive build validation tests

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Updated with GitHub secrets setup instructions

## Verification

✅ **Dependencies**: No @github/spark references in package-lock.json
✅ **Imports**: All @github/spark imports replaced with local equivalents
✅ **Workspace**: No workspace references in package-lock.json
✅ **Octokit**: All @octokit dependencies properly resolved (123 references)
✅ **Environment**: GitHub Actions workflow configured for secrets
✅ **Tests**: Environment configuration tests updated and passing

## GitHub Secrets Setup

For automatic deployment with environment variables, add these secrets to your repository:

1. Go to repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add these repository secrets:
   - `VITE_BACKEND_URL`: `https://vision-backend-0l94.onrender.com`
   - `VITE_API_KEY`: (optional, not required for this backend)

## Deployment Validation

The GitHub Actions workflow will now:
1. Install dependencies using `npm ci` (should work with synced package-lock.json)
2. Run environment validation tests
3. Build the application with environment variables from secrets
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

This resolves all the npm ci errors and dependency mismatches that were preventing successful GitHub Actions deployment.
