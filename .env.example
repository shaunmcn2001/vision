# NDVI Vision Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values

# Backend API Configuration
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-api.com
# Example: VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://ndvi-api.example.com

# API Authentication Key
VITE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
# Example: VITE_API_KEY=abc123def456ghi789

# Development Notes:
# - Replace the example values above with your actual backend URL and API key
# - These variables will be used by the Vite build system
# - The VITE_ prefix is required for Vite to include them in the build
# - Keep your .env file secure and never commit it to version control

# Production Deployment:
# For GitHub Pages deployment, set these as repository secrets instead:
# 1. Go to your GitHub repository
# 2. Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
# 3. Add VITE_BACKEND_URL and VITE_API_KEY as repository secrets
# 4. The GitHub Actions workflow will use these automatically
