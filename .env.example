# NDVI Vision Environment Configuration
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values

# Backend API Configuration
VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://vision-backend-0l94.onrender.com
# Example: VITE_BACKEND_URL=https://vision-backend-0l94.onrender.com

# Development Notes:
# - Replace the example value above with your actual backend URL if different
# - This variable will be used by the Vite build system
# - The VITE_ prefix is required for Vite to include them in the build
# - Keep your .env file secure and never commit it to version control

# Production Deployment:
# For GitHub Pages deployment, set this as a repository secret instead:
# 1. Go to your GitHub repository
# 2. Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
# 3. Add VITE_BACKEND_URL as a repository secret
# 4. The GitHub Actions workflow will use this automatically
